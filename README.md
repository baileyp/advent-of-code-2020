# Advent of Code 2020

These are my solutions for the [2020 Advent of Code puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

## Requirements

 1. Python 3
 
## Setup

None

## Running

Just use `python` to run the `aoc` module.

To run Day 1, Part 1 with the input I received:

```bash
$ python -m aoc 1 1
```

Or you can run it with any input file

```bash
$ python -m aoc 1 1 path/to/input/file.txt
```

Or you can run it with input directly as an argument

```bash
$ python -m aoc 1 1 abcdefg
```

## Notes

Within the comments of each file I'll be capturing some very simple notes about the algorithm and space/time complexity.
In any notes that reference Big O notation, `n` will always refer to the number of lines or items in the puzzle input,
unless otherwise noted.

### Puzzles

Here are my thoughts or lessons learned from the puzzles.

*No puzzles yet!*

## Testing

There are both unit tests and integration tests, all of which require `pytest`.

The integration tests prove the full solutions using the sample input data provided by the puzzle descriptions, when
available.

To run:

```bash
# All tests
$ pytest

# Unit Tests
$ pytest tests/unit/

# Integration Tests
$ pytest tests/integration/

```
